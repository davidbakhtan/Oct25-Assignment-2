Very excited to do more and start a full project we started adding some programming files in this project.

This project is a web-based interactive platform where users can explore different musical instruments such as drums, piano, and guitar. Users can click on each instrument to hear its sound. The project uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.This project is a web-based interactive platform where users can explore different musical instruments such as drums, piano, and guitar.
